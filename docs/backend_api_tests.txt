This document contains a list of tests in order to check on the functionality of the backend
of the RemoteUAC server!! These requests will be sent to backend/app/install_requests.py.
The returns of each request vary, at the moment they are very *bare* since I don't have a ton of
functionality!

Each of these were tested on POSTMAN, however you could very well try these on bash using curl.


## Health check

GET http://localhost:8000/

return: Response Code = 200 OK

{ "message": "RemoteUAC backend is running." }


## Mock POST request

POST http://localhost:8000/api/request

{
  "device_id": "TEST-DEVICE-01",
  "app_name": "example_installer.exe",
  "size": "15MB",
  "path": "C:/Desktop/Downloads",
  "download_source": "https://website_example.com/installed",
  "requested_changes": {
    "PATH": true,
    "Registry": ["HKLM\\Software\\Example"]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:00:00"
}

return: Response Code = 201 Created

{
    "device_id": "TEST-DEVICE-01",
    "app_name": "example_installer.exe",
    "size": "15MB",
    "path": "C:/Desktop/Downloads",
    "download_source": "https://website_example.com/installed",

    },
    "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:00:00",
    "id": 1,
    "status": "pending"
}


## Second Device POST as a way to address the id function!

POST http://localhost:8000/api/request

  "device_id": "TEST-DEVICE-02",
  "app_name": "example_installer.exe",
  "size": "15MB",
  "path": "C:/Desktop/Downloads",
  "download_source": "https://website_example.com/installed",

}
